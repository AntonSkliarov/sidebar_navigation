*****
#### To do

  * add separate functions for events callbacks


#### To fix

  * When the page reloaded on the other section then HOME, the active point on the sidebar changed to 1st. Need to track the current section at the viewport.
  * After the first usage of `.goTo` method, the second and all next calls lead to a bag. The section is changing not correct.
